# Durkheim Theory

## Overview

Note, table of contents on the right sidebar is a good way to navigate long notes. Most notes have a `## Quotes` section. Note, I source from both books (`1893` & `1895`), see [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Who is Durkheim\|Who is Durkheim]] for more info.

Key ideas that could be covered:

- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Societal Shift\|Durkheim's Societal Shift]]: The implications of society shifting from segmentary to organised.
	- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Abnormal Division of Labour\|Durkheim's Abnormal Division of Labour]]: Potential implications of above shift.
- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality\|Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality]]: The differences in freedom & personality for society bound by [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Mechanical Solidarity\|Mechanical Solidarity]] vs [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organic Solidarity\|Organic Solidarity]].

See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Durkheim Quotesheet\|Durkheim Quotesheet]] for cheatsheet.

## My Thoughts

- Durkheim missed out improving Standard of Living as a moral fact?
- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]] belongs to each Culture within a society
	- Society's Collective Consciousness is an average, cultures within society may have [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts\|Moral Facts]] that deviate from it
		- [[Polarisation\|Polarisation]] is when these cultures start to really disagree on what is moral
			- Different from [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Division of Labour/Anomic Division of Labour\|Anomic Division of Labour]]?
- IMO, the nature of [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]] changes (more tolerant & general) but remains unlike Durkheim who think it weakens as societal shift occurs ([[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Societal Shift\|Durkheim's Societal Shift]])
- Durkheim invented meritocracy before the term was coined
- Durkheim was a globalist (world government) before the term was coined
