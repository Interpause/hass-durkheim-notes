# Structural Functionalism

## Overview

Note, below are largely based on Durkheim as an example of a Structural Foundationalist so see [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim Theory\|Durkheim Theory]] & [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/02.003 Social Science/_assets/Durkheim - Division of Labour in Society (Partial) (1893)\|Durkheim - Division of Labour in Society (Partial) (1893)]] as well.

### Functionalist Mindset

- Views society as a system of interrelated parts/functions/organs
	- "The whole must be given priority because its influence is greater than that of a single part." (Durkheim, ????, pg 362)
- Systems naturally equilibrate
- Focus on social order as the most impt metric to maintain
- Institutions/Social structures are what drives Societal Development
	- "The more widespread an institution, the more lasting and profound the need to which it corresponds" (Durkheim, ????, pg 365)
		- Society's needs are reliant on institutions that govern them
- Consensus is the ultimate basis of social order
	- "Social life is above all a harmonious community of endeavours, when minds and will come together to work for the same aim" (Durkheim, ????, pg 363)

### Structural Functionalism

- Structures that maintain the stability of society include: households, political systems, economic systems, education & laws
	- Structures are added and removed as society deems necessary
	- For example Industrialization replaced Slavery for the purpose of production
		- Slavery lost its purpose
- Maintain order & keep society functioning
- Society can be out of balance during upheavals or rapid change as social norms & laws have yet to form to regulate interactions and promote peace & cooperation (Anomie)
	- Have to reinstate norms & structures before equilibrium can be re-achieved
- The collectivity trumps and is more impt than the individual
- Maintain objective perspective while analyzing relationships between functional groups/social structures/institutions of society
- What is moral isnt the researcher's opinion, its what the society deems as moral (this can be objectively measured via surveys for example)
	- So we are looking at whether homosexuality is moral to a society, rather than whether its inherently moral
	- Though, as durkheim claims the collectivity is the most impt, ultimately, society is the determining factor of morality for him
- Should study society from the outside, rather than based on own personal experiences; Done by viewing collectivity as a separate entity to yourself
	- Social facts, Institutions & the law are some examples of the collectivity which are extrinsic and can be objectively measured
