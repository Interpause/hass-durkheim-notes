## Quotes

### Division of Labour Increases Standard of Living

> "It is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in the consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people." (Smith, 1776, pg 115)

- Division of Labour -> Exponential Productivity in all fields -> Excess
- In a well-governed society, excess diffuses throughout society
- As excess diffuses, lowest ranks of people have better standard of living
- Excess is same as Surplus
