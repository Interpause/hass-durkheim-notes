# Durkheim's Societal Shift

## Overview

As we transition from [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Segmentary Society\|Segmentary Society]] to [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organised Society\|Organised Society]], [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]] weakens and is gradually substituted by [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Division of Labour\|Division of Labour]] as the dominant source of [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Societal Solidarity\|Societal Solidarity]].

## Implications

Shifting from [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Segmentary Society\|Segmentary Society]] to [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organised Society\|Organised Society]] means [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Societal Solidarity\|Societal Solidarity]] is increasingly provided by [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organic Solidarity\|Organic Solidarity]] over [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Mechanical Solidarity\|Mechanical Solidarity]].

Most implications to the [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Social Facts\|Social Facts]] (including [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts\|Moral Facts]]) are due to the differences in the natures of [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Mechanical Solidarity\|Mechanical Solidarity]] & [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organic Solidarity\|Organic Solidarity]] and changing between them.

- Division of Labour is increasingly critical for [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Societal Solidarity\|Societal Solidarity]].

### Too Fast

- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Division of Labour/Anomic Division of Labour\|Anomic Division of Labour]]
- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Division of Labour/Forced Division of Labour\|Forced Division of Labour]]

### Mechanical vs Organic Solidarity

- Focus of [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts\|Moral Facts]] shifts from conformity to ensuring harmony & peace of interdependence.
	- Shift from [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Repressive Laws\|Repressive Laws]] to [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Restitutive Laws\|Restitutive Laws]] making up most of society's laws.
	- See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality\|Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality]] for quotes.
- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality\|Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality]]: Members of society need conform less & and have more freedom.
	- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organic Solidarity\|Organic Solidarity]] means we are different by definition, so conformity is senseless.
	- Collectivism -> Individualism.
		- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organic Solidarity#Quotes\|Organic Solidarity#Quotes#Cult of the Individual]]
- Although [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]] is weakened, the most essential & general [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts\|Moral Facts]] remain.
	- i.e., murder is bad.

## Why

This might not be accurate, based on summaries & recitation rather than source material.

- Ppl move to towns & cities -> Increased Social Density.
- Density -> Acute Competititon -> [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Division of Labour\|Division of Labour]] to avoid competition.
	- See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Societal Shift#Quotes\|#Quotes#Competition causes Division of Labour]].
- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Division of Labour\|Division of Labour]] -> Higher productivity -> More ppl move -> Increased Social Density.
- More interdependent ties over higher Social Density -> [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Dynamic Density\|Dynamic Density]] -> More morality compared to diffused [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Organic Solidarity\|Organic Solidarity]]?
	- Its in [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/02.003 Social Science/_assets/Durkheim - Division of Labour in Society (Partial) (1893)\|Durkheim - Division of Labour in Society (Partial) (1893)]] Book 1 Chapter 2 _The Causes_ which I skipped.
	- #FINDQUOTE
- J-H: I believe Weber's Rationalization/Modernization is a better explanation of what causes the shift in society (Division of Labour as economic role).

## Quotes

### Competition causes Division of Labour

> "If labour becomes increasingly divided as societies become more voluminous and concentrated, it is not because the external circumstances are more varied, it is because the struggle for existence becomes more strenuous." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 208)

> "Thanks to [Division of Labour], rivals are not obliged to eliminate one another completely, but can coexist side by side." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 213)

### Essential Condition

> "Not only does the division of labour exhibit that character by which we define morality, but it increasingly tends to become the essential condition for social solidarity." (Durkheim, 1893, 332)
