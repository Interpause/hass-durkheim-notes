## Quotes

### Why is Societal Solidarity Increasing?

> "How does it come about that the individual, whilst becoming more autonomous, depends ever more closely upon society?" (Durkheim, 1893, pg 7)

### Morality is Societal

> "As for what is termed individual moralityâ€¦ which would bind him only to himself and would consequently subsist even if he were alone, this is an abstract conception that has no foundation in reality." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 332)
