### Collective Consciousness

See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]].

> "The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own...

See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Restitutive Laws\|Restitutive Laws]].

(Durkheim, 1893, pg 335)

> "that network of ties that gradually becomes woven of its own accord and that makes organic solidarity something that is permanent." (Durkheim, 1893, 303)

> "Thus the morality corresponding to [mechanical] society has lost influence, but without its successor developing quickly enough to occupy the space left vacant in our consciousness." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 339)

### Forced Division of Labour

See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Division of Labour/Forced Division of Labour\|Forced Division of Labour]].

> "It requires us only to be charitable and just towards our fellow-men, to fulfil our task well, to work towards a state where everyone is called to fulfil the function he performs best and will receive a just reward for his efforts." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 338)
