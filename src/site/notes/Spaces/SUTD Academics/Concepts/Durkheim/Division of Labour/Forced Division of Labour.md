# Forced Division of Labour

## Overview

When Division of Labour is based on some pre-existing tradition.

- Holding onto the obsolete traditions/[[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts\|Moral Facts]] of the dying [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Segmentary Society\|Segmentary Society]].
	- i.e., Using Caste, Bloodline, Nobility to assign who can be engineers or politicians.
	- See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Division of Labour/Forced Division of Labour#Quotes\|#Quotes#Resolution]].
- Not necessarily that Caste is encoded in law, can be social norms that hinder social mobility.
	- See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Division of Labour/Forced Division of Labour#Quotes\|#Quotes#Curse of Castes]].
- The solution is "meritocracy".
	- See [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Division of Labour/Forced Division of Labour#Quotes\|#Quotes#Resolution]].
	- Solution isn't to revive old traditions now widely regarded as unfair.
	- Note, Meritocracy as a term wasn't coined in Durkheim's time, so he only alludes to the concept.

## Quotes

### Curse of Castes

> "When the caste regime has disappeared by law, it survives in morality. Thanks to the persistence of certain prejudices, a certain favouritism is attached to some individuals, and the converse, unrelated to their merits, obtains for others." (Durkheim, 1893 pg 313)

### Resolution

> "It requires us only to be charitable and just towards our fellow-men, to fulfil our task well, to work towards a state where everyone is called to fulfil the function he performs best and will receive a just reward for his efforts." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 338)

> "the remedy for the ill is nevertheless not to seek to revive traditions and practices that no longer correspond to present-day social conditions" (Durkheim, 1893, pg 339)

## My Thoughts

- Meritocracy is the ideal that one deserves the product of their effort and talents.
	- In lieu of infinite resources, its an okay principle.
- However, the talent one has is a matter of not only Nature but Nurture.
	- In Nature, not all talents can be surmounted by just effort.
		- It is unfair I wasn't born with that athlete's genesâ€¦
	- In Nurture, Socio-Economic Mobility may be lacking, hindering development of talent.
		- Generational Wealth
		- Castes
		- Or even Generational Wealth associated with Castes
- The ideal of Meritocracy should be one where everyone is given equal opportunity to exert effort to develop their talents.
	- Free (optional) tuition for everyone.
	- Socio-mobility between schools instead of depending on one-shot major exams.
- Downsides:
	- Makes the Rat Race EVEN WORSE.
	- Too much mobility = no time to form bonds.
- At the very least, school lines should not be solely divided by talent to prevent caste formation.
	- However, the downsides of uniform education are also quite bad.
	- Only solution is truly personalized education.
- Is there any practical alternative?
