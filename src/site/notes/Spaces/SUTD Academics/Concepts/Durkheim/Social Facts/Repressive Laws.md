## Quotes

### Common Characteristic of all Crimes

> "Now the only characteristic to satisfy that condition refers to the opposition that exists between crime of any kind and certain collective sentiments." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 40)

> "In other words, we should not say that an act offends the common consciousness because it is criminal, but that it is criminal because it offends that consciousness." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 40)

### Injury made Good

> "It is a sign indicating that the sentiments of the collectivity are still unchanged, that the communion of minds sharing the same beliefs remain absolute, and in this way the injury that the crime has inflicted upon society is made good." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 63)
