# Moral Facts

## Overview

What a society determines is moral or not.

	- Some facts simply exist for [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Mechanical Solidarity\|Mechanical Solidarity]] and have no utility otherwise like [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts#Being Naked\|#Being Naked]].

## Quotes

### What is a Moral Fact

> "Moral facts are phenomena like any others. They consist of rules for action that are recognisable by certain distinctive characteristics." (Durkheim, 1893, pg xxv)

> "any fact of a vital nature - as moral facts are - cannot survive if it does not serve a purpose or correspond to some need." (Durkheim, 1893, pg xxviii)

### Undermine Society

> "For, whatever the origin of these sentiments, once they constitute a part of the collective type, and particularly if they are essential elements in it, everything that serves to undermine them at the same time undermines social cohesion and is prejudicial to society. In their origin they had no usefulness, but, having survived, it becomes necessary for them to continue despite their irrationality." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 62)

### Roman State

> "If the ancient Romans had not the broad conception of humanity that we possess today,â€¦ but because such ideas were incompatible with the nature of the Roman State" (Durkheim, 1893, Preface pg. xxvi)
