## Quotes

### Status Quo

> "If certain acts have already been performed, the judge restores them to what they should be. He pronounces what the law is, but does not talk of punishment." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 68)

### Conceivably Changed

> "The idea that murder can be tolerated sets us up in arms, but we very readily accept that the law of inheritance might be modified, and many even conceive that it could be abolished." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 69)

> "rules where sanctions are restitutory either constitute no part at all of the collective consciousness, or subsist in it in only a weak state." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 69)
