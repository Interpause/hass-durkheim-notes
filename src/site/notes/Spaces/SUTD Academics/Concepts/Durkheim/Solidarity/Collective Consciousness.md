### What is Collective Consciousness

> "The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own... By definition it is diffused over society as a whole, but nonetheless possesses specific characteristics that make it a distinctive reality." (Durkheim, 1893, pg 39)

### Moral Force

> "there exists no moral force superior to that of the individual, save that of the collectivity" (Durkheim, 1893, pg 67)
