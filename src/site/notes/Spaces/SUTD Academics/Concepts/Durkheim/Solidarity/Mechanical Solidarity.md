# Mechanical Solidarity

## Overview

Solidarity of society through members conforming to [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]].

- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]]: Bound together by similar human experience; The same ideas, sentiments, beliefs, morals, etc.
	- Everyone should have the same values & judgement unto others.
- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Repressive Laws\|Repressive Laws]] are the most obvious [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Social Facts\|Social Facts]] that can be used to measure [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Mechanical Solidarity\|Mechanical Solidarity]].
	- Stronger [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]] -> More sensitive to Deviance -> More repression.

### Freedom

- Less freedom & individuality based on [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality\|Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality]].
	- [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Theories/Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality#Quotes\|Durkheim's Freedom and Individuality#Quotes#Inverse Proportionality]]: Strength of Mechanical Solidarity inversely proportional to personality.
- More [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts\|Moral Facts]]; More restrictive & less freedom.
	- Some are irrational & exist only to declare your sameness & belief in the [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Collective Consciousness\|Collective Consciousness]]'s ideas.
		- i.e., that we have to wear clothes.
	- Strongest, most essential moral rules of society to conform to are encoded as [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Repressive Laws\|Repressive Laws]].
- Must have & exert the same moral judgement as society; Deviance is punished.
	- Breaking [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Repressive Laws\|Repressive Laws]] gets you punished; breaking [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Social Facts/Moral Facts\|Moral Facts]] gets you outcasted.
	- Must be punished/outcasted to show behaviour is unacceptable to the collective.
	- Allowing trangressions to go unpunished, deviants to walk the streets, weakens the Solidarity as members don't feel safe.
		- Y'know "safe space".

## Examples

- National Education is a form of [[Spaces/SUTD Academics/Concepts/Durkheim/Solidarity/Mechanical Solidarity\|Mechanical Solidarity]].
	- Creates common beliefs about society & what is moral, how to behave in society.
